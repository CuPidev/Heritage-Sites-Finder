This looks like a fascinating course project on Information Retrieval! Since you have 3 people in your group, I'll structure the steps and requirements specifically for a three-student project based on the uploaded documents.

🚀 Information Retrieval Course Project Plan (3 People)
I. Project Goal and Scope
The core goal is to design, implement, and evaluate a working prototype of an information retrieval system (search engine) based on assigned user and system requirements.

Team Size: 3 students (a joint project).

Data Source: You will be assigned a specific topic and an example website to crawl. You must crawl multiple sources (websites) similar in content and topic to the one suggested.

Deliverables:

The complete code of the project (design and implementation).

A report (max. 10 pages, including cover) explaining the design, implementation, and evaluation of the system.

II. Required Project Steps
The project must follow these four main steps:

Design

Design the search engine architecture.

Justify all your design choices.

Search Engine Implementation

Implement the system to gather a large collection of samples, build the collections, and enable search over the data.

Search Interface Implementation

Implement an interface for searching, browsing, and presentation of the data to the user.

Evaluation (User Evaluation)

Your project will be user-evaluated by at least 3 users (of your choice, who are also students in the class).

Coordinate with other groups to meet the deadline.

Note: System evaluation (i.e., recall and precision) is NOT required.

III. Required Features for a 3-Person Group
Based on the rules for team size, a group of three must implement three additional features in total:

1 Simple Feature

2 Complex Features

Feature Type Specific Features (Pick 1 Simple, Pick 2 Complex) Description
Simple (Pick 1) Results Presentation Results in a tabular format; each cell contains appropriate information.
Filtering Filter results based on at least 3 relevant attributes for your project.
Results Snippets Present snippets (max 2-3 lines) in a "Google style" with query terms highlighted.
Complex (Pick 2) Automatic Recommendation Suggest "similar" items based on criteria (category, description, price, etc.) in addition to search results. Use open-source recommenders if needed.
User Relevance Feedback Allow users to provide positive or negative feedback on results (relevant/irrelevant). Update and present search results again based on this feedback.
Results Clustering Group search results into topics. Allow expanding/shrinking to show/hide all related results. Topics should be sorted by the number of relevant results under them.

Would you like me to suggest a way to divide the responsibilities among your three team members, focusing on the required features?
